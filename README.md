The Financial Sentiment Analysis project in Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to harness the power of advanced language models to analyze and interpret sentiments expressed in financial text data. By leveraging NLP techniques, the project seeks to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of unstructured financial data, including news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and other relevant textual sources.
