The Financial Sentiment Analysis project in Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to harness the power of advanced language models to analyze and interpret sentiments expressed in financial text data. By leveraging NLP techniques, the project seeks to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of unstructured financial data, including news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and other relevant textual sources. 
The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of textual data from various sources such as financial news articles, social media posts, earnings reports, and investor sentiment indices. It includes
both structured and unstructured data, making it ideal for NLP tasks. The dataset provides a rich source of information for training and evaluating sentiment analysis models in the financial domain.
The dataset consists of the following variables: Sentence: Unstructured textual data from financial news, reports, or social media. Sentiment: Categorized sentiment labels such as positive, negative, or neutral, assigned to each text document.
